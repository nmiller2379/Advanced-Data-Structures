# Reverse a doubly linked list
Let's create one more method for our doubly linked list called reverse which reverses the list in place. Once the method is executed the head should point to the previous tail and the tail should point to the previous head. Now, if we traverse the list from head to tail we should meet the nodes in a reverse order compared to the original list. Trying to reverse an empty list should return null.

## Coding challenge
Implement the reverse method for the DoublyLinkedList class. The method should reverse the list in place. Once the method is executed the head should point to the previous tail and the tail should point to the previous head. Trying to reverse an empty list should return null.
